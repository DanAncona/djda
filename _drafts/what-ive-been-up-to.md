In the summer of 2016, I was innocently minding my own business, tooling along Route 10, coming back from a fabulous weekend at the legendary YxYY, talking with a pal who works in advertisng at a little firm in NY. (not really that little, their revenue figures end in a "B")

At one point he asked, "Why do the Dems ads suck so much?"

The bad news is, this problem is still ongoing.

The good news is, we have a glimmer of evidence that messages that can not just beat Trump, but start to hack away at the much bigger problem: the underlying beliefs that gave rise to him.

If you need a summary,

In 2018, the new funding network Way to Win ran a small ($350k) pilot, paid digital communications program. See waytowin.us for background. I was the campaign lead. It was below everyone’s radar and we haven’t talked about it publicly until now; not being particularly secretive, just were waiting for the next steps to become more clear.

We produced four flights of ads, some in-house with a video partner (Haley Jude of movingportraits.tv) and some with a commercial firm. The messages were based on new, deep race/class research [1], and we used a “scientifically optimized creative” approach to test them. [2]

The results were overwhelmingly positive, particularly the issue-based messages we did in-house. One round of 15s messages was in the top 10% of content on the testing platform we used. (Swayable)

Our closing argument message tested significantly better than two Trump ads (one positive and one very negative) and better than a moderate, big budget (Bloomberg-funded) Dem spot.

We distributed this work to around 1M voters each on FB and YouTube - mostly congressional races in FL, but also NV, and a bit in SD and IN.

Next steps and new partners are still coming into focus but will build on the strategy/success we had in 2018. For more information (including a copy of the summary slide deck) contact Dan Ancona - dan@danancona.com or 415-373-8972.

What You Can Do
---------------

I don't know if this is the right thing to do or not. 

sign up and make a pledge
need something deeper. sharing? reading? brave new words lol?
crowdsourced ad tracking?
imagination battle??


But, but, but

Over the last year, I've run into a _lot_ of confusion and skepticism about this work.

*We should just do field.* It's fucked up to pit local leaders against AI powered, silicon-valley fueled, GOP funded, Russian bots, candidates and say "here's a bunch of money, go knock on some doors ... good luck!"

*We don't want to just give more money to Facebook and Google.* This is, to my mind, absolutely the biggest substantial objection.

But here's the thing. The Dems are going to spend piles on this stuff anyway. The ads had better fucking say something. If they don't, it's an incredible waste. We should build new platforms to reach people, absolutely. But it's tricky, and expensive. The bottom line is that the ad products that Google and FB is, for now at least, an excellent deal. We can reach voters for around a "CPM" (marketing dork-ese for "cost per thousand impressions) of $5 per thousand for static ads and around $20 per thousand for video.

Google, Facebook, the programmatic platforms, AIs, bots, the Russians, the Ukrainians, the alt-right, Ben Shapiro, the commercial marketing industry, the GOP and the rest of the right wing and all their consultants, and the gazillions of dollars they have but

Right now Trump is flooding these channels with garbage that's being echoed by everyone from local politicians to mass shooters. I track left and Dem groups (not obsessively, but I do try to keep an eye on them, and so far NONE of them are responding. I can only guess as to why, but the prevailing wisdom in DC is that they have option other than Looking Tough.
