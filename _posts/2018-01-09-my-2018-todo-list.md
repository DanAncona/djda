Welcome! After the 47 trazillionith time of getting this advice, I am finally setting up my own dang blog on my own dang website! I've been writing on Medium for the past few years, and I love the design & UX, but it's time to branch out.

A quick nerd-note: this newfangled site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jeykllrb.com/), a technology that us geeky sorts call a "static site generator." It's like a geekier version of WordPress. It's a fabulous tool for mocking up simple sites (it's what the [Always Forward]() demo site is built from too). You need to be familiar with version control and editing text files to use it, but it's a great way to get your feet wet with that. If it sounds interesting, I'm happy to answer questions about it!

## 2018 Projects
It's better to have too many projects than too few! But this may be getting a tad ridiculous. One of my big challenges for 2018 is going to be focus.

Placeworks Civic - For the past few years, building this civic engagement platform for the urban design firm PlaceWorks has been my main day job. The platform is a set of highly customizable tools for encouraging scalable, democratic, design thinking about land use. Last fall, we took a big new step, getting it one step closer to the "Real Life SimCity" vision, with a project in Livermore that got some [fabulous coverage on the local TV news](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Livermore-Asks-Community-to-Help-With-Downtown-Design-Plans-449570903.html?34). (I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've seen camera angles pointed at a screen running my software. At least since the 90s!) This is one of the most fascinating projects I've ever had a chance to work on, and it's aimed right at a super thorny strutural problem: the housing crisis. And I'm really excited about the plans we have for this year for it, starting with a big new client for it, and building a marketing site so people know it exists.

Venus Shrugged - Part one came out last April, and I have the deep, time-consuming structural edits for part 2 on my desk. I've learned a lot about book marketing in the past year.

Always Forward - This is a new grassroots PAC and accountability tracking tools. This is either going to take off in the first quarter or so, or I'm sticking it on the back burner. It's moving on three tracks: the first one is the accountability, targeting & tracking tools, the second one is the messaging/PAC side of it, and the new but long-term third track is around building distributed AI tools for activists. The first step is applying to New Media Ventures

Democratic Future Club - I

Home life - Jenifer is still rocking WDN, so I'm still primary parenting. (If you don't believe me, [listen to rising mega-superstar consultant Jessica Byrd talking about their work on Kamau Bell's podcast](https://player.fm/series/politically-re-active-with-w-kamau-bell-hari-kondabolu-1401856/is-this-what-democracy-looks-like-jake-tapper-jessica-byrd-give-their-take) - the good stuff starts around 6 minutes in) Including cooking dinner for the mini-cohousing every night-ish, pitching in at school periodically and my second season coaching little league.



## 2017 Books

One of the best parts about (mayyyyybe) becoming a writer is that it is the BEST excuse to read tons of books. Sorry I didn't bother with links for all these, I'm just too lazy. But these can all be found ideally at your friendly local bookseller, or easily delivered to one via [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org)! (And they can also probably be found via giant conglomerate with disturbing labor practices, but, you're on your own for that.) I'm not really getting into recommendations because all of these were pretty great.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
