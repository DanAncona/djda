I"N<p>Below are short vidoes and ads that I’ve either written, co-authored or had a significant hand in developing, along with the results from opinion-lift testing. Most of the testing I’ve done has been on <a href="https://swayable.com/">Swayable</a>. (for the ones that aren’t embedded, click to see them)</p>

<p>My belief is that racism is a scam that has been perpetuated by elites from the foundation of this country, for the specific purpose of dividing people to maintin a system of predatory capitalism and economic domination. The stories I try to tell are about imagining a more just, welcoming democracy, based on solidarity and interdependence. A lot of these ads are based on or use bits from the <a href="https://raceclassnarrativeaction.com/">Race Class Narrative</a>, developed by Anat Shenker-Osorio. (and many others)</p>
