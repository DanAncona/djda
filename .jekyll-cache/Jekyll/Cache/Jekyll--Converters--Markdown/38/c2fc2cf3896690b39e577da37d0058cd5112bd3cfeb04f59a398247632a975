I"q<p>Welcome! After the 47 trazillionith time of getting this advice, I am finally setting up my own dang blog on my own dang website! I’ve been writing on Medium for the past few years, and I love the design &amp; UX there, but it’s time to branch out. My focus here is going to be dispatches from my corner of the Imagination Battle, the phrase that <a href="http://adriennemareebrown.net/2016/06/12/national-network-of-abortion-funds-2016-keynote/">Adrienne Marie Brown</a> borrowed from <a href="http://www.intelligentmischief.com">Terry Marshall</a> that about perfectly ties together everything I’m working on.</p>
