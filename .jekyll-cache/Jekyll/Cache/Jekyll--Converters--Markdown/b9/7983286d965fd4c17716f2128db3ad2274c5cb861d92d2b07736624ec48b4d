I"Þ<p>The events of the past couple of weeks have reminded me of something. Itâ€™s a file that Iâ€™ve kept floating around my desktop for years. I think it was orginally published in either BoingBoing or Wired, or both, but I canâ€™t find the original links to it. The earliest copy I have in my archives says 2007, so it must have been from around then.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve kept it hanging around because itâ€™s an absolute masterpiece of propaganda. The production values, artwork, storytelling and copywriting all come together in such a beautiful and persuasive way, along with a heaping pile of dog-whistle and just-plain-calling-the-dog racism, Nancy Pelosi hatred, thinly veiled anti-Semitism, fear, othering, fear and more fear.</p>
