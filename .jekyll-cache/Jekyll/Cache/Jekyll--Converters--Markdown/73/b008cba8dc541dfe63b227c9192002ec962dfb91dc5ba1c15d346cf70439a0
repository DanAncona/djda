I"ç <p>Welcome! After the 47 trazillionith time of getting this advice, I am finally setting up my own dang blog on my own dang website! I‚Äôve been writing on Medium for the past few years, and I love the design &amp; UX there, but it‚Äôs time to branch out. My focus here is going to be dispatches from my corner of the Imagination Battle, the phrase that <a href="http://adriennemareebrown.net/2016/06/12/national-network-of-abortion-funds-2016-keynote/">Adrienne Marie Brown</a> borrowed from <a href="http://www.intelligentmischief.com">Terry Marshall</a> that about perfectly ties together everything I‚Äôm working on.</p>

<p>A quick nerd-note: this newfangled site is powered by <a href="http://jeykllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a technology that us geeky sorts call a ‚Äústatic site generator.‚Äù It‚Äôs like a geekier version of WordPress. It‚Äôs a fabulous tool for mocking up simple sites (it‚Äôs what the <a href="http://alwaysforwardus.com/">Always Forward</a> demo site is built from, too). You need to be familiar with version control and editing text files to use it, but it‚Äôs a great way to get your feet wet with that. If it sounds interesting, I‚Äôm happy to answer questions about it!</p>

<h2 id="2018-projects">2018 Projects</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs better to have too many projects than too few! But this may be getting a tad ridiculous. One of my big challenges for 2018 is going to be focus.</p>

<p><em>Placeworks Civic</em> - For the past few years, building this civic engagement platform for the urban design firm <a href="http://placeworks.com/">PlaceWorks</a> has been my top client. The platform has evolved into a set of highly customizable tools for encouraging scalable and democratic design thinking about land use. Last fall, it took a big step towards closer to the ‚ÄúSimCity for Real Projects With Real Data‚Äù vision, with a project in Livermore that got some <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Livermore-Asks-Community-to-Help-With-Downtown-Design-Plans-449570903.html?34">fabulous coverage on the local TV news</a>. (I‚Äôm pretty sure this is the first time I‚Äôve seen camera angles pointed at a screen running my software. At least since the 90s!) This is one of the most fascinating projects I‚Äôve ever had a chance to work on, and it‚Äôs aimed right at a vexing, complicated and strutural problem, the housing crisis. I‚Äôm really excited about the plans we have for this year for it, starting with a big new client, and next building a marketing site so that I have somewhere to link to and you can read more!</p>

<p><em><a href="http://readvenusshrugged.com/">Venus Shrugged</a></em> - Part one came out last April, and I have the deep, time-consuming structural edits for part 2 on my desk. I‚Äôve learned a lot about book marketing in the past year, but it basically all boils down to: keeping writing and participate in conversations. There‚Äôs too many variables to say when part 2 will be out, but I swear, it‚Äôs happening.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://alwaysforwardus.com/">Always Forward</a></em> - This is a new grassroots PAC and provider of accountability and tracking tools for elected represenatives. This is either going to take off in the first quarter or so, or I‚Äôm sticking it on the back burner. It‚Äôs moving on three tracks: the first one is the accountability, targeting &amp; tracking tools, the second one is the messaging/PAC side of it, and the new but long-term third track is around building distributed AI tools for activists. The first step is applying to New Media Ventures new open call on <a href="http://www.newmediaventures.org/7th-innovation-fund-open-call-shift-story/">shifting the story</a>.</p>

<p><em>Democratic Future Club</em> - This one hasn‚Äôt gotten past the pile of notes stage, but I really miss being involved locally. When Jenifer and I were involved years ago locally in Santa Barbara, it was some of the most deeply satisfying work I‚Äôve ever done. And there‚Äôs a big gap for a local club that would be diverse and accessible to people who can‚Äôt regularly make it to meetings, either because of their work, or because of kids or disabilities. Not sure I‚Äôll get to this one!</p>

<p><em>Home and Fun</em> - Jenifer is still rocking her role at WDN, so I‚Äôm still primary parenting. (If you don‚Äôt believe how much she rocking it, <a href="https://player.fm/series/politically-re-active-with-w-kamau-bell-hari-kondabolu-1401856/is-this-what-democracy-looks-like-jake-tapper-jessica-byrd-give-their-take">listen to rising mega-superstar consultant Jessica Byrd talking about their work on Kamau Bell‚Äôs podcast</a> - the good stuff starts around 6 minutes in) This includes cooking dinner for the mini-cohousing every night-ish, pitching in at school periodically and my second season coaching little league. And as foolish as it sounds, I might have a fun side project popping up, but I can‚Äôt say much about it yet.</p>

<h2 id="2017-books">2017 Books</h2>

<p>One of the best parts about (maybe!) becoming a writer is that it‚Äôs been a great excuse for reading tons of books. Almost makes the gnashing of teeth around book marketing worth it! Sorry I didn‚Äôt bother with links for all these; I got too much stuff to do! But these can all be found ideally at your friendly local bookseller, or easily delivered to one via <a href="https://www.indiebound.org">IndieBound</a>! (And they can also probably be found via giant conglomerate with disturbing labor practices, but, you‚Äôre on your own for that.) I‚Äôm not really getting into recommendations or not here. (beyond what‚Äôs in the parentheses - again, too much to do!) Honestly, all these were pretty great, and you should be showering their authors with money.</p>
