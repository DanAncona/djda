I"Ð<p>Weâ€™re still on lockdown from COVID. Millions of trees are on fire, and the air is sodden with strange, gray-orange smoke. Trump is provoking Nazi-crazed
17 year old vigilantes
armed with assault rifles. AND STILL WE ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ RISE! Celebrating my new fancy-pants DJ gear (an XDJ-XZ), upgraded internets (for better streaming!), and the launch of Way to Leadâ€™s
new advertisment, <a href="https://twitter.com/waytoleadus/status/1304047252705484800?s=20">Whatâ€™s Possible</a>, and either impending or eventual victory!
This was a fun <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thedjda">twitch stream dj party</a>, too, with friends coming by from Amsterdam, Mexico, and other exotic locales
like two exits down the 580.</p>
