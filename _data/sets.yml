- title: LIMINAL SPACE DANCE AT BURNING MAN 2017
  year: 2017
  date: 1 Sept
  desc: The nice folks at Liminal Labs gave me a chance to DJ on Friday night at Burning Man 2017. It was a night of Quality Playa Entertainment,
    with Barbarella playing on the big truck projection system in the background,
    and the camp fire spinners put on a show next to the 16 foot, fire shooting metal gate. It was my first one in 11 years so I went out
    there without a gig lined up or a set prepped, but I ended up going through the last three+ years of sets in a dust storm one afternoon,
     and pulled out a bunch of the best tracks across all those gigs. 
    The genres process through ceremonial bass, funky house (with an old-school detour), neofunk, a little poppy stuff, through to ephiphanic breaks
    and then on to my take on the current state of deep house.

  desc: Pretty, floaty stuff into breaks and electroswing, into a little funky house, into some smoochie love bass. And some old school funk and Led Zeppelin, somehow. Sounds weird but it seemed to work epically well.

# YES AND YES YES 003

# June 02015. One of my (numerous) favorite parts about the summer creative/techie conference YxYY is that I pretty much always get a chance to dj my face off. This year I played sets at the pool, prom and the last-day morning daybreaker.
