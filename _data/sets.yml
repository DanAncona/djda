    This was a life- and worldview-altering set. I wish I knew why. Sometimes it just all clicks. Not sure it quite comes across in the recording, particularly since I 
    didn't hit the dang button until a half an hour in or so!
    But just a nice crowd and fantastic vibes from the first minute through to the slightly hectic bonus 20 minutes or so I got
    from the DJ who went after me (the delightful <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bettyraydio">Betty Ray</a>), who ran into some tech issues.
    Get on the <a href="https://unison.stream">Unison</a> list to hear about the next one!<br/><br/>
    You can also watch this on the
    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/992895209">Unison twitch channel</a>.
    A bit of the audio is muted, (the labels don't want us to buy their music!) but some total hottie
    rolls up and starts shaking her groove at around the 50 minute mark, our kiddo enters the chat at 1h 1m, and there are a couple 
    epic Rocket Leauge goal replays starting at 1h 8m.

    Epic three hour New Years Eve day party stream. Went global again, and started mid-afternoon Pacific time but made it to midnight in Amsterdam!

    We're still on lockdown from COVID. Millions of trees are on fire, and the air is sodden with strange, gray-orange smoke. Trump is provoking Nazi-crazed
    17 year old vigilantes
    armed with assault rifles. AND STILL WE ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ RISE! Celebrating my new fancy-pants DJ gear (an XDJ-XZ), upgraded internets (for better streaming!), and the launch of Way to Lead's
    new advertisment, <a href="https://twitter.com/waytoleadus/status/1304047252705484800?s=20">What's Possible</a>, and either impending or eventual victory!
    This was a fun <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thedjda">twitch stream dj party</a>, too, with friends coming by from Amsterdam, Mexico, and other exotic locales
    like two exits down the 580.

  year: 2020
  date: 19 May
  desc: This was my first stream from quarantine, with the Stream Equinox crew. Many thanks to Dave Simon and dj geo for hooking me into this!
        Mix of minimal, funky, and emo house, with a little swirl of French stuff.

  year: 2019
  date: 16 Sept
  desc: From an afternoon Oakland pool party. First set that's been worth posting in just over two years! Opens weird with that Kygo remix of the song from
    the Hobbit, which I love but I admit is a strange starting point. Turns into happy minimal poolside house soon enough after that though.

- title: LIMINAL SPACE DANCE AT BURNING MAN 2017
  year: 2017
  date: 1 Sept
  desc: The nice folks I camped with at Liminal Labs gave me a chance to DJ on Friday night at Burning Man 2017.
    We had Barbarella playing on the big truck projection system in the background,
    and the camp fire spinners put on a show next to the 16 foot, fire shooting metal gate. It was my first one in 11 years, so I went out
    there without a gig lined up or a set prepped, but during a dust storm one afternoon, I hid out in the truck pulling some of the best of 
    my last three or four years of sets. This is the result.
    The genres process roughly through ceremonial bass, funky house
    (with an old-school detour for a political message that's been on my mind lately),
    some neo-funk, a little poppy stuff, some ephiphanic breaks
    and then on to my take on the current state of deep house. Photo credit&#58; [Ellen Steuer](http://ellen.org/).

  year: 2017
  date: March 18
  desc: Pretty, floaty stuff into breaks and electroswing, into a little funky house, into some smoochie love bass.
    And some old school funk and Led Zeppelin, somehow. Sounds weird but it seemed to work epically well.
