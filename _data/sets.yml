    We're still on lockdown from COVID. Millions of trees are on fire, and the air is sodden with strange, gray-orange smoke. Trump is provoking Nazi-crazed
    17 year old vigilantes
    armed with assault rifles. AND STILL WE ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ RISE! Celebrating my new fancy-pants DJ gear (an XDJ-XZ), upgraded internets (for better streaming!), and the launch of Way to Lead's
    new advertisment, <a href="https://twitter.com/waytoleadus/status/1304047252705484800?s=20">What's Possible</a>, and either impending or eventual victory!
    This was a fun <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thedjda">twitch stream dj party</a>, too, with friends coming by from Amsterdam, Mexico, and other exotic locales
    like two exits down the 580.

        Mix of minimal, funky, and emo house, with a little swirl of French stuff.

- title: SPLISH SPLASH
  year: 2019
  date: 16 Sept
  desc: From an afternoon Oakland pool party. First set that's been worth posting in just over two years! Opens weird with that Kygo remix of the song from
    the Hobbit, which I love but I admit is a strange starting point. Turns into happy minimal poolside house soon enough after that though.

- title: LIMINAL SPACE DANCE AT BURNING MAN 2017
  year: 2017
  date: 1 Sept
  desc: The nice folks I camped with at Liminal Labs gave me a chance to DJ on Friday night at Burning Man 2017.
    We had Barbarella playing on the big truck projection system in the background,
    and the camp fire spinners put on a show next to the 16 foot, fire shooting metal gate. It was my first one in 11 years, so I went out
    there without a gig lined up or a set prepped, but during a dust storm one afternoon, I hid out in the truck pulling some of the best of 
    my last three or four years of sets. This is the result.
    The genres process roughly through ceremonial bass, funky house
    (with an old-school detour for a political message that's been on my mind lately),
    some neo-funk, a little poppy stuff, some ephiphanic breaks
    and then on to my take on the current state of deep house. Photo credit&#58; [Ellen Steuer](http://ellen.org/).

  year: 2017
  date: March 18
  desc: Pretty, floaty stuff into breaks and electroswing, into a little funky house, into some smoochie love bass.
    And some old school funk and Led Zeppelin, somehow. Sounds weird but it seemed to work epically well.
